# TouchBarLyrics
modified from https://github.com/ChenghaoMou/touchbar-lyric 
When used in combination with LyricsX which stores the lyrics locally in local/src, it solves the problem of obtaining incorrect lyrics. 
Convert.py converts lyrics from lyricsX in local/src to local/final; main.py searches for available lyrics in local/final and displays the lyric if available.
